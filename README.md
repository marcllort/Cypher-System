# Cypher-System

Compile:
make

Run the program:
Trinity Config.dat

Client-Server program for the Operating Systems class.
The program is able to connect between 2 or more other instances of the program and communicate with them as if it was a typical chat application (but in command line, no UI). It allows you to show connections, so you know who you can connect to, and once connected to one or more users you can send messages to an specific user, broadcast messages to all the users you are connected to, and even download files (txt, mp3, mp4... whatever you want).

For more information, please refer to the Cypher.pdf file where a more detailed explanation is given (Automatic translation from catalan to english, you will probably find many translation errors).
